    <p>There are several great attractions near the conference place. You can travel around by yourself after the event.</p>
    <h2>San Francisco</h2>
    <img border="2" src="/templates/1.jpg" alt="SF1" width="300" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px">
    <img border="2" src="/templates/2.jpg" alt="SF1" width="300" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px">
    <p>San Francisco (Spanish for "Saint Francis") was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established a fort at the Golden Gate and a mission named for St. Francis of Assisi a few miles away. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. Due to the growth of its population, San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856. After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire, San Francisco was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama-Pacific International Exposition nine years later. During World War II, San Francisco was the port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, massive immigration, liberalizing attitudes, and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States.<br><br>
Today, San Francisco is one of the top tourist destinations in the world, and is renowned for its cool summers, fog, steep rolling hills, eclectic mix of architecture, and landmarks including the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, the former prison on Alcatraz Island, and its Chinatown district. It is also a primary banking and finance center.(From Wikipedia)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h2>Stanford University</h2>
    <img border="2" src="/templates/3.jpg" alt="SF1" width="300" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px">
    <img border="2" src="/templates/4.jpg" alt="SF1" width="300" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px">
    <p>
      Stanford University is located on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus on the San Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of the Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley) approximately 37 miles (60 km) southeast of San Francisco and approximately 20 miles (32 km) northwest of San Jose.<br><br>Contemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts and art gallery, the Stanford Mausoleum and the Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin sculpture garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish. Frank Lloyd Wright's 1937 Hanna-Honeycomb House and the 1919 Lou Henry and Herbert Hoover House are both listed on the National Historic Register.(From Wikipedia)

    <h2>Silicon Valley</h2>
    <img border="2" src="/templates/5.jpg" alt="SF1" width="300" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px">
    <p>Silicon Valley is the southern region of the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California, in the United States. The region, whose name derives from the Santa Clara Valley in which it is centered, is home to many of the world's largest technology corporations as well as thousands of small startups. The term originally referred to the region's large number of silicon chip innovators and manufacturers, but eventually came to refer to all the high-tech businesses in the area; it is now generally used as a metonym for the American high-tech sector.<br><br>Despite the development of other high-tech economic centers throughout the United States and the world, Silicon Valley continues to be the leading hub for high-tech innovation and development, accounting for one-third (1/3) of all of the venture capital investment in the United States. Geographically, the Silicon Valley encompasses all of the Santa Clara Valley including the city of San Jose (and adjacent communities), the southern Peninsula Valley, and the southern East Bay. However, with the rapid growth of technology jobs in the San Francisco metropolitan area, the traditional boundaries of Silicon Valley have expanded north to include the rest of San Mateo County and the City and County of San Francisco, as well as parts of Marin County.(From Wikipedia)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h2>Napa Valley vineyard & winery</h2>
    <img border="2" src="/templates/6.jpg" alt="SF1" width="300" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px">
    <img border="2" src="/templates/7.jpg" alt="SF1" width="300" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px">
    <p>Napa Valley is widely considered one of the top American Viticultural Areas in California, and all of the United States, with a history dating back to the early nineteenth century. Napa Valley features more than four hundred wineries and grows many different grape varieties including Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Zinfandel, and other popular varietals. Napa Valley is visited by as many as five million people each year.(From Wikipedia)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h2>Lake Tahoe</h2>
    <img border="2" src="/templates/8.jpg" alt="SF1" width="300" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px">
    <img border="2" src="/templates/9.jpg" alt="SF1" width="300" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px">
    <p>Lake Tahoe is a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada of the United States. At a surface elevation of 6,225 ft (1,897 m), it is located along the border between California and Nevada, west of Carson City. It is a major tourist attraction in both Nevada and California. It is home to a number of ski resorts, summer outdoor recreation, and tourist attractions. Snow and skiing are a significant part of the area's economy and reputation. Mountain and lake scenery are attractions throughout the year.(From Wikipedia)</p>
