	    <h2> CAEPA March 4 Talk: Transitioning to Alternative Energy: A Roadmap for 50 States and 139 Countries by Professor Mark Jacobson of Stanford University</h2>
    <p>Global warming, air pollution, and energy insecurity are three of the most significant problems facing the world today. This talk discusses the development of technical and economic plans to convert the energy infrastructure of each of the 50 United States and 139 countries of the world to those powered by 100% wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) for all purposes, namely electricity, transportation, industry, and heating/cooling, after energy efficiency measures have been accounted for. The presentation slides can be<a href="/history/1503CAEPA-OaklandWWS.pdf" target="_blank"> found here</a>. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>About our Speaker </strong><br> Mark Z. Jacobson is Director of the Atmosphere/Energy Program and Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. He is also a Senior Fellow of the Woods Institute for the Environment and of the Precourt Institute for Energy.  He received a B.S. in Civil Engineering, an A.B. in Economics, and an M.S. in Environmental Engineering from Stanford in 1988.  He received an M.S. and PhD in Atmospheric Sciences in 1991 and 1994, respectively, from UCLA and joined the faculty at Stanford in 1994. He develops and applies computer models to understand air pollution, global warming, and renewable energy resources.  He has published two textbooks of two editions each and 140 peer-reviewed journal articles.  He received the 2005 American Meteorological Society Henry G. Houghton Award and the 2013 American Geophysical Union Ascent Award for his work on black carbon climate impacts and the Global Green Policy Design Award for developing state and country energy plans.

	        <h2> CAEPA tour of UC Berkeley Green Infrastructure, Saturday September 13</h2>
    <p>Please join the Chinese American Environmental Professionals Association for a Green Infrastructure tour at the U.C. Berkeley campus on Saturday, September 13 from 10:00 am to 11:30 am. The tour will be led by Tim Pine, Environmental Protection Specialist, UC Berkeley Office of Sustainability. Come learn about the University’s efforts to integrate cutting edge sustainable practices into facilities, landscaping and building designs. The Office of Sustainability has set ambitious sustainability goals to reduce the campus ecological footprint and to engage the university community to reduce its energy and water use. Some of highlights include recent low impact development projects where storm water is managed through infiltration (Davis Hall swale and Blum Center rain gardens), detention/retention (VLSB/Dwinelle Parking Lot lawn and pond), removal of impervious surfaces (Wellman Courtyard and various pathway replacements) and re-establishment of drought resistant native vegetation (Li Ka Shing Center). The tour will also look at existing sites that pose storm water challenges and discussion of some solutions proposed for these areas.</p>
